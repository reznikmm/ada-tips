## Addressed problem

The `Max_Entry_Queue_Length` aspect addresses two key problems:

- **Unbounded Queue Growth**: In traditional Ada, entry queues could grow
  indefinitely, potentially leading to memory exhaustion or unpredictable
  delays. This aspect allows you to set explicit bounds, preventing uncontrolled
  growth.

- **Timing Analysis Challenges**: Unbounded queues make it difficult to
  accurately analyze the real-time behavior of concurrent systems. By enforcing
  maximum queue lengths, you can provide more predictable timing guarantees,
  which is crucial for safety-critical and real-time applications.

So, Ada 2022's `Max_Entry_Queue_Length` aspect puts limits on task and protected
entry queue sizes, boosting predictability and aiding timing analysis.
