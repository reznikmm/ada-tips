## Addressed problem

The new declare expressions in Ada 2022 solve the problem of repeated
expressions within contracts and other complex expressions. Previously, Ada
developers had to copy and paste the same expression multiple times, leading to:

- **Readability issues**: Duplicate code makes contracts and expressions harder
  to understand and follow.
- **Maintenance challenges**: Modifying an expression requires updating all its
  copies, increasing the risk of inconsistencies.
- **Error proneness**: Manually copying expressions can introduce typos or other
  errors.

Declare expressions address these issues by allowing developers to:

- Declare local constants and object renamings directly within an expression.
  This eliminates the need to duplicate the same expression, keeping the code
  clean and concise.
- Improve readability and maintainability. Contracts and expressions become
  easier to understand and modify since the logic is concentrated in one place.
- Reduce errors. The risk of introducing typos or inconsistencies is minimized
  by eliminating the need for repeated code.

Overall, declare expressions offer a powerful tool for writing cleaner, more
maintainable, and less error-prone Ada code, especially when dealing with
complex contracts and expressions.
